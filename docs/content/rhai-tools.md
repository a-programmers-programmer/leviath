# Rhai tools and policy rules

This page covers two things that both live in Rhai scripts. [Writing a tool](#declaring-a-tool)
gives your agents a new capability. [Policy rules](#policy-rules) decide whether a tool call is
allowed to fire. They are unrelated jobs, so read whichever half you came for.

Every `.rhai` file in `~/.leviath/tools/` is compiled at spawn and offered as a tool to **every**
agent. That is how you give all your agents a shared capability without editing each blueprint.

Per-agent tools live in that agent's own `tools/` directory instead, and are checked by
`lev validate <agent>`. A per-agent tool with the same name shadows the global one.

> [!WARNING]
> The directory is `~/.leviath/tools/`, inside Leviath's data root next to `providers/` and
> `agents/`. It is not `$HOME/tools/`. Every `.rhai` file here becomes a tool for every agent, and
> not every file in it was written by you: once a run uses `install_global_tool`, the
> directory holds model-authored code as well. Each installed file starts with a
> `// installed by leviath: agent run in <workdir> at <unix seconds>` line naming where it came
> from, and every call to any tool here is still gated by the tool policy (`ask` by default, waived
> only by `--yolo`). Audit the directory with `lev tools`, which lists each tool with its
> description and parameters, and remove a tool by deleting its `.rhai` file (and any sibling
> `.toml`): the next spawn no longer sees it.

## Declaring a tool

A tool declares itself with leading `// @` directives and reads its arguments from the `params`
object. The recognized directives:

- `// @tool <name>` is required and names the tool. A stage sees it when its `available_tools`
  lists that name or includes `@scripts`, the [tool group](/docs/tools#tool-groups) that grants
  every Rhai tool the install has.
- `// @description <text>` is an optional one-liner shown to the model.
- `// @param <name> <type> <required|optional> "<description>"` is repeatable. `<type>` is a JSON
  schema type: `string`, `integer`, `number`, `boolean`, `array`, `object`. A typo here produces a
  schema that does not compile, which switches off
  [argument validation](/docs/tools#argument-validation) for the tool (the daemon logs a warning);
  calls still run, with no argument check.
- `// @requires <cap> [<cap>...]` lists platform capabilities the tool needs (`network`, `shell`,
  `filesystem`), comma or space separated and repeatable. Leviath drops the tool where the platform
  cannot provide one.
- `// @accepts <type> [...]` and `// @produces <type> [...]` name the mime types the tool reads as
  [parts](/docs/mime) and hands back as parts (`image/*`, `audio/wav`), comma or space separated
  and repeatable. Advisory: `lev tools` shows them, and a stage that needs a `video/mp4` can be
  checked against the tools it holds.

The script's return value becomes the tool result: a string is returned verbatim, anything else is
JSON-encoded, and a bare `()` is an empty string. A missing optional param reads as `()`. One shape
is special: a map with a `parts` list, `#{ content: "...", parts: [ ... ] }`, is a result that
carries typed parts beside its text. Each entry is a part map as `write_part` or `find_part` handed
it back; the text is the `content`, or nothing when it is left off.

## Host functions inside a tool

A tool gets a wider host surface than a provider script, because it acts on behalf of a running
agent. The functions come in two kinds.

**These reach the outside world**, and each one is gated per function by
[`[tool_script_permissions]`](/docs/configuration#tool_script_permissions), resolved at spawn. A
tool's `@requires` line is not a gate: it only filters which platforms discover the tool at all.

| Function | Does |
|---|---|
| `http_get(url [, headers])` | An HTTP GET, as text. A body that is not text is refused, not decoded. See below |
| `http_get_bytes(url [, headers])` | The same GET, as bytes: a map with `mime_type` and `bytes`, ready for `write_part`. See below |
| `http_post(url, body [, headers])` | An HTTP POST |
| `shell(cmd)` | Runs a shell command |
| `read_file(path)` | Reads a file, always confined to the workdir |
| `read_file_bytes(path)` | The same file, as bytes: an exact Rhai blob, ready for `write_part`. See below |
| `write_file(path, content)` | Writes a file |
| `env_var(name)` | Reads an environment variable. Credential-shaped names need [`allow_env_vars`](/docs/configuration#security) |
| `read_part(name)` | The bytes of a stored [part](/docs/mime) the run holds, as a Rhai blob. See below |
| `write_part(bytes [, type [, name]])` | Stores bytes as a part of the run and returns its map. See below |
| `list_parts()` | Every stored part the run holds, as maps |
| `find_part(name)` | One part's map by name or hash prefix, or `()` |

`http_get` refuses a body that is not text, such as an image, a sound or a PDF, and the message
names its type. It does not decode those bytes into noise. `http_get_bytes` is how you fetch them.
Its `mime_type` is the one the server declared, its `bytes` are a Rhai blob, and bodies over 32 MiB
are refused before they are read. It is gated like `http_get`.

`read_file_bytes` is for a file that is not text, like an image your shell command rendered or a
design someone handed you. The blob is exact. Files up to `[mime] max_part_bytes` are read, and
larger ones are refused before they are read. It is gated and confined like `read_file`.

`read_part` takes a file name, or the first six or more characters of a part's sha256. Reading
needs no permission, because the part is already the run's. `write_part` sniffs the type when you
leave it off and makes up a name, such as `part-3.png`. It is gated like `write_file`, and charged
to the run's write budget.

A part map carries `mime_type`, `name`, `sha256`, `size`, `width`, `height`, `duration_ms`,
`tokens` and `stand_in`. The parts a tool can name are the ones in the agent's context window when
the batch was dispatched, plus whatever the tools in that batch wrote. A tool that takes an image by
name reads `params.image` and calls `read_part` on it; the model names parts the way the stand-in
in its context does, by file name.

**These are pure** and need no permission, because they only transform values you already have:

| Group | Functions |
|---|---|
| JSON and encoding | `parse_json`, `to_json`, `encode_uri`, `encode_base64`, `decode_base64`, `html_to_text` |
| Strings | `contains`, `starts_with`, `ends_with`, `trim`, `join`, `split` |
| Content | `count_tokens`, `is_json`, `is_markdown`, `is_mermaid`, `is_empty`, `content_format` |

`decode_base64` fails rather than returning something wrong, in two ways worth telling apart. Input
that is not valid base64 says so. Input that is valid base64 but decodes to bytes that are not UTF-8
says *that*. Base64 carries any bytes and a Rhai string holds text, so a script decoding an image
has asked for something the function cannot return. Both reach the model as an `[error]` line naming
your tool, so a script that hits one stops rather than carrying on with an empty string.

## A complete tool

A minimal transform tool, `~/.leviath/tools/upper.rhai`:

```rhai
// @tool upper
// @description Upper-case text
// @param text string required "input to transform"
params.text.to_upper()
```

A tool that does real I/O, `~/.leviath/tools/web_fetch.rhai`. It declares the `network` capability,
fetches a URL, and hands the model readable prose instead of raw HTML:

```rhai
// @tool web_fetch
// @description Fetch a URL and return its readable text
// @param url string required "the URL to fetch"
// @requires network
let body = http_get(params.url);
html_to_text(body)
```

A tool that makes a part. It renders a diagram with a command-line tool, then reads the picture the
command wrote as bytes and hands it back typed. A model that sees images sees the diagram. One that
does not sees a line naming it:

```rhai
// @tool render_diagram
// @description Render a Mermaid diagram to a PNG
// @param source string required "the Mermaid source"
// @produces image/png
// @requires shell
write_file("work/diagram.mmd", params.source);
shell("mmdc -i work/diagram.mmd -o work/diagram.png");
let png = read_file_bytes("work/diagram.png");
#{ content: "rendered the diagram", parts: [write_part(png, "image/png", "diagram.png")] }
```

The source goes through a file rather than into the command line, so nothing the model writes is
ever run by the shell.

For parameter shapes that directives cannot express (enums, array `items`, numeric bounds), drop a
sibling `.toml` named after the script (`export.toml` beside `export.rhai`). When present it
overrides the annotations entirely:

```toml
# ~/.leviath/tools/export.toml   (beside export.rhai)
[tool]
name        = "export"
description = "Export in a chosen format"
requires    = ["filesystem"]

[[tool.params]]
name     = "format"
required = true
schema   = { type = "string", enum = ["json", "yaml"], description = "output format" }
```

## Installing a tool from a run

A running agent can add a tool itself. Both built-ins take the tool's `name`, the complete `.rhai`
`source`, and an optional `overwrite` flag, compile the script, and write it out. This is the
persist path for mechanical learnings. A step an agent worked out by hand once, such as a parsing
routine, a repeated lookup or a fixed transformation, becomes a tool that later runs call instead of
rediscovering it.

What differs is who ends up with the tool:

| Built-in | Writes to | Who sees it |
|---|---|---|
| `install_self_tool` | the agent's own `tools/` | that agent's runs, and nothing else |
| `install_global_tool` | `~/.leviath/tools/` | every agent on the machine that asks for script tools |

Reach for `install_self_tool`. What an agent learns is usually about its own job, and the wide one
arms every agent that names `@scripts` or `@all` with code one agent wrote. `install_tool` is the
name they were split out of, and it still works: it means `install_global_tool`, which is what it
always did.

Neither one falls back to the other. An agent with no blueprint directory to write to is told so,
rather than quietly installing machine-wide.

The install is refused, and nothing is written, when the script:

- Does not compile.
- Has no `// @tool` or `// @description`.
- Declares a `// @tool` name that differs from `name`.
- Takes the name of a built-in, sub-agent or MCP tool.
- Exceeds 256 KiB.
- Would replace an existing script without `overwrite`.

A script that takes one of those reserved names is dropped at discovery, so it would never run.
A sibling `<name>.toml` that declares a different `[tool] name` is refused too, since the TOML
would win and the tool would appear under the other name. The result the model reads back names
the file, the description, the parameters and the required capabilities.

Three things keep the directory yours:

- Every installed file starts with a `// installed by leviath: agent run in <workdir> at <unix
  seconds>` comment, so `cat` and `lev tools` show which run wrote it. The comment carries no `@`
  directive and compiles as an ordinary comment.
- Both are `ask` by default, like `write_file` and `shell`. A blueprint or `config.toml` can set
  `install_self_tool = "allow"` under `[tool_permissions]`, and `--yolo` waives the prompt for
  an unattended run. See [Security](/docs/security) for what an unattended run can persist.
- The script's own calls are still gated when it runs: an installed tool reads the same
  [`[tool_script_permissions]`](/docs/configuration#tool_script_permissions) as a hand-written one.

A tool is meant for repeatable mechanical steps, never for judgement. A script that encodes a
decision the model should be making each time ages badly and is hard to notice from the outside.

To use an installed tool in the same run, the agent needs
[`tool_rescan`](/docs/agents#discovering-tools-mid-run): `after_writes` picks the new tool up on its
next turn, and `before_dispatch` also picks it up in the turn that wrote it. Any later run sees it at spawn, and a stage advertises it when its
`available_tools` names it or includes `@scripts`. See [Tools](/docs/tools) for how a stage's tool
set is put together.

## Inspecting the inventory

`lev tools` lists the global inventory without starting the daemon. Compiled tools are marked. A
file that failed to compile is shown with its reason, and is not advertised at all. A tool whose
`@requires` capability the platform cannot satisfy is flagged unavailable:

```bash
lev tools           # human-readable inventory, params, requires, and skipped files
lev tools --json    # machine-readable, including param schemas and required capabilities
```

See [Tools](/docs/tools) for how a stage's `available_tools` and `tool_permissions` gate which tools
an agent may actually call.

## Policy rules

The [taint gate](/docs/security) blocks any tool that could send data off the machine when that data
is more sensitive than the tool is cleared for. Sometimes a specific case is fine and you want to say
so.

`policy.toml` handles the simple cases with a static allowlist. For anything that needs a decision
rather than a list, write a rule as a `.rhai` file in the `leviath/rules/` directory under your OS
config dir. That is `~/.config/leviath/rules/` on Linux and
`~/Library/Application Support/leviath/rules/` on macOS.

Rules are consulted after the static allowlist, and the first script that allows a call wins. The
filename becomes the rule's name in any decision it makes.

Each rule receives a `context` map with `tool`, `target`, and `taint_level` (a string: `"public"`,
`"internal"`, or `"private"`), and evaluates to a boolean. `true` allows the call.

```rhai
// <config dir>/leviath/rules/company.rhai
context.tool == "send_email"
    && context.target == "ops@corp"
    && context.taint_level == "internal"
```

Rules are re-read when they change. Add a file, edit one, or delete it, and the next run is gated
against what the directory holds now, with no daemon restart. `policy.toml` beside it reloads the
same way. A run already going keeps the rules it started under.

A script that errors or does not evaluate to a boolean is treated as no match, so a broken rule can
never accidentally open the gate. Inspect and dry-run rules with the CLI:

```bash
lev policy list                                              # static + scripted rules
lev policy test send_email --target ops@corp --taint internal
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Scripted rules only ever **allow** calls the gate would otherwise block. They cannot tighten the
> gate or override a deny. See [Security](/docs/security) for the taint model and the full gate
> decision flow.
