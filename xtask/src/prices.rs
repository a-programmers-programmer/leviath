//! `cargo xtask prices` - refresh the vendor list prices without a person or
//! an AI in the loop.
//!
//! Anthropic, OpenAI, Google and Meta quote no price through their APIs (xAI
//! does, and its rows are the fallback for a listing that cannot be read), so
//! `crates/leviath-providers/pricing/rates.toml` carries their list prices and
//! a cost computed from it is only as current as the file. Keeping it current
//! by hand means transcription, and transcription is where a wrong digit gets
//! in. This command reads the same list prices from two places that do publish
//! them programmatically and writes the file only where they agree:
//!
//! * OpenRouter's public catalogue (`/api/v1/models`, no key), which carries
//!   each vendor's models under the vendor's own prefix with the vendor's list
//!   price, and is what Leviath already prices OpenRouter runs from;
//! * LiteLLM's `model_prices_and_context_window.json`, a community table of
//!   the same prices, as the cross-check.
//!
//! The rules are fixed so two runs on the same inputs write the same file:
//!
//! * a model both sources price within 5% is written with `source = "both"`,
//!   at OpenRouter's figure;
//! * a model only one source prices is written with that source's name;
//! * a model the two price more than 5% apart is not written; the existing
//!   row, if any, is kept and the disagreement is printed;
//! * a row whose `source` is `manual` is never overwritten;
//! * a model id is kept as the vendor writes it, minus the vendor prefix
//!   (`openai/`, `anthropic/`, `google/`, `meta/`, and OpenRouter's `x-ai/`
//!   for xAI). Of Meta's models only Muse Spark is kept: the catalogues also
//!   list open-weights models Meta's API does not serve. OpenRouter spells Anthropic's versions
//!   with a dot (`claude-opus-4.8`) where the API id has a dash
//!   (`claude-opus-4-8`), so those are normalised. Variants after a colon
//!   (`:batch`, `:free`, `:thinking`) are routing options, not models, and
//!   are dropped;
//! * a new id that a shorter new id covers as a prefix at the same price, such
//!   as `gpt-5.5-2026-04-23` beside `gpt-5.5`, is not written. Lookup is by
//!   longest matching prefix, so the shorter row already prices it;
//! * a cache-read rate is taken as published. A cache-write rate is taken only
//!   when it is at least the input rate: a write is a premium on input, and a
//!   figure below input (OpenRouter lists Google's per-hour storage price in
//!   that field) is not a per-token rate. Either defaults to the input rate;
//! * a source entry with a zero or negative input or output price is not a
//!   price (a free tier, or a model priced by the image) and is dropped;
//! * a long-context tier (a higher rate for a whole request once its prompt
//!   reaches a threshold) comes from LiteLLM's `*_above_<N>k_tokens` fields,
//!   the only source that publishes one, and rides on the row whichever
//!   source vouched for the base rates;
//! * `[[unit_rate]]` rows price media models per image, second of video, hour
//!   of audio, million characters or music clip. LiteLLM publishes most of
//!   them (`source = "litellm"`, rewritten on every refresh); a row a person
//!   wrote is kept as it is, wins over LiteLLM's for the same prefix, and is
//!   reported once it was checked more than 90 days ago.
//!
//! And it refuses, leaving the file untouched, when any existing row would
//! move by more than 3x, when the finished table has a row with no positive
//! output price, or when either source lists nothing for one of the three
//! providers. Any of those is a broken source or a broken parser, and a bad
//! table is worse than a stale one.
//!
//! `--check` prints the diff and exits 1 if the file would change, touching
//! nothing. A network failure exits 2, also touching nothing.
