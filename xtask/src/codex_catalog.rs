//! Whether the compiled Codex model catalog still matches what OpenAI ships.
//!
//! The Codex route has no `/models` endpoint, so
//! `crates/leviath-providers/src/codex/catalog.rs` carries the list as a
//! compiled table. A table nobody checks is a table that rots, and the two
//! ways it rots are both quiet: a model withdrawn or renamed stays offered
//! and fails at the first call, and a model newly served stays unreachable -
//! `serves_model` refuses it locally, so somebody pays for a subscription
//! that includes a model Leviath will not route to.
//!
//! There is no authoritative source to fix that from. Which models Codex
//! serves is a product decision published nowhere, and only an authenticated
//! ChatGPT session can enumerate them. So this does not rewrite the table; it
//! reads the same OpenRouter catalogue `prices` already fetched and reports
//! what looks wrong, every Monday, where somebody will see it.
//!
//! Two directions, and they are not equally trustworthy:
//!
//! * a catalog id no price source knows is probably renamed or withdrawn, and
//!   is worth acting on. Codex-only models are exempt: `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`
//!   is real and OpenRouter will never list it;
//! * an OpenAI model in the same family that the catalog lacks *may* be newly
//!   served, or may be a model Codex does not offer at all. OpenRouter lists
//!   every OpenAI model, most of which Codex has never served, so this half is
//!   a prompt to check rather than a finding.
