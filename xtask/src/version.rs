//! `cargo xtask version` - move the workspace version, or check it is coherent.
//!
//! A release is triggered by the workspace version moving, which makes the bump
//! the single most consequential edit in the repo - and it is spread across
//! thirteen lines of two manifests. `[workspace.package] version` is what every
//! crate inherits, and the eleven `[workspace.dependencies]` entries each repeat
//! it because `cargo publish` refuses a path dependency with no version
//! requirement. Cargo offers no way to make those requirements inherit the
//! workspace version, so they have to be written out, and they have to agree.
//! The thirteenth is `leviath-cli`'s allocator pin, which lives in that crate's
//! own manifest on purpose - only the composition-root binary should pick an
//! allocator - and so is invisible from the root.
//!
//! Getting that wrong is quiet. Within a `0.1.x` line a stale `version =
//! "0.1.2"` pin is a `^0.1.2` requirement that `0.1.3` satisfies, so everything
//! builds and publishes - it just ships crates whose interdependencies name the
//! previous version. It only turns loud on a bump that crosses the caret
//! boundary (`0.1.x` to `0.2.0`), and by then the alpha shipped a week earlier.
//!
//! So: `set` writes all thirteen at once, and `check` is the CI guard that
//! fails a hand-edit which touched only some of them.
//!
//! `check` also compares the two `[profile.release]` blocks, for the same
//! reason: `leviath-cli`'s copy is what a `cargo install leviath-cli` build
//! uses (that manifest is the root when there is no workspace), so drift there
//! ships a binary built differently from the released one.
