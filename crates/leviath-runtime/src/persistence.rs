//! Agent-state persistence: turning a live ECS agent into the on-disk snapshot
//! the dashboard/API read (`meta.json` + `context.json` under the run directory).
//!
//! This module holds the **pure** serialization core - components that carry an
//! agent's run identity and running token totals, plus functions that build the
//! [`RunMeta`]/[`ContextSnapshot`] value types from an agent's live components.
//! It does no I/O; the async write lane and the snapshot-dispatch system layer on
//! top of these.
