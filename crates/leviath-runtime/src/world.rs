//! The pipeline driver: a single [`PipelineWorld`] that hosts every agent as
//! ECS data and ticks the [`crate::pipeline`] systems over all of them - the
//! traditional-game-loop core of the shared world.
//!
//! The world owns the bevy [`World`], the tick [`Schedule`], the per-model
//! inference pools, and the async bridges (inference jobs + the tool worker).
//! Systems never block: they dispatch async work to the bridges and collect the
//! results on a later tick. Between ticks the driver **parks** on a wake
//! [`Notify`] until an async result lands or an external message arrives, so an
//! idle world costs ~0 CPU regardless of how many (paused/blocked) agents it
//! holds.
//!
//! ## Idle detection (no busy-spin)
//!
//! Each outer iteration drives the schedule to a **fixed point**: it ticks until
//! a tick produces no change in the per-phase marker counts (the "fingerprint").
//! At quiescence every remaining agent is either waiting on an in-flight async
//! job (which will `notify` on completion) or blocked on a resource that only an
//! async completion can free (a full pool) or on nothing at all (a missing
//! provider / no input) - so the driver parks on the wake instead of spinning.
//! A fresh async result or an external `send_message` fires the wake and the
//! fixed-point loop re-runs.
