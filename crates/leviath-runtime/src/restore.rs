//! Restart recovery: bring a freshly-spawned agent back to its persisted running
//! state so the daemon resumes it where it stopped.
//!
//! When the daemon restarts, the CLI reloads each non-terminal run's blueprint
//! and spawns a fresh agent, then calls [`restore_agent`] to overlay the persisted
//! context, jump to the persisted stage + iteration, and restore token totals,
//! plus [`restore_stage_ledger`] for the run's per-stage history. The
//! agent keeps the `ReadyToInfer` marker `spawn_agent` set, so **any inference
//! that was in flight when the daemon stopped is re-issued** on the next tick -
//! nothing is left stuck awaiting a job that died with the old process.
//!
//! A tool batch that was in flight is not blindly re-issued, though: when the run
//! journal holds a dispatched-but-unapplied batch, [`restore_pending_batch`]
//! reconstructs its assistant turn in the window first - real journaled results
//! for calls that completed, a verify-first [`INTERRUPTED_TOOL_RESULT`] for calls
//! that didn't - so the re-issued inference sees exactly what already ran and
//! completed side effects never run twice.
