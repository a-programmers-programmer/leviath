//! The world host: the daemon-side wrapper that owns a single [`PipelineWorld`],
//! maps stable **run ids** to ECS entities, and interleaves external **control
//! operations** with driving the world - all on one task, so there is never any
//! locking around the world.
//!
//! Clients (a control socket, the TUI, the CLI) don't hold entities - those are
//! generational indices meaningful only inside the world. They address agents by
//! run id. The host keeps the `run_id → Entity` map and turns each
//! [`ControlOp`] into the corresponding [`PipelineWorld`] call, replying on the
//! op's oneshot channel.
//!
//! The serve loop drives the world to quiescence, then parks until either an
//! async result wakes it, a control op arrives, or shutdown is signalled -
//! handling a control op and then re-driving to quiescence so its effect (a
//! resume, a delivered message) is applied immediately.
