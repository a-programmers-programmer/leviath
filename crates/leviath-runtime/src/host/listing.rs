//! What `lev ps` and the control socket see: one row per run, live from the
//! world rather than re-read from disk.
//!
//! [`wait_reason`](WorldHost::wait_reason) is the interesting part. A status of
//! `Waiting` says nothing about whether a person is needed, so the row carries
//! why.
//!
//! Retention lives here too, and deliberately: a finished run stays listable for
//! a while after it ends, so how long the list keeps one is a property of the
//! list rather than of the health bookkeeping next door.
