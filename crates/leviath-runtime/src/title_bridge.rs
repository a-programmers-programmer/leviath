//! The async worker side of run-title generation - the sync-ECS to async-I/O
//! bridge for the titling call.
//!
//! `dispatch_title` (in [`crate::title`]) builds the request and hands it off
//! as a [`TitleJob`] with a pool permit; [`run_title_job`] makes the provider
//! call - retrying a transient refusal on the dispatch lane's own schedule -
//! reports a [`TitleOutcome`], and wakes the tick loop so the collect system
//! can store the title.
//!
//! Titling is still best-effort in that it never fails the agent: the outcome
//! carries a `Result`, and a run whose name could not be generated keeps
//! showing its task text. It is not *silent*, though: the outcome's error
//! reaches `collect_title`, which either moves the run to the next candidate
//! provider or records why the run has no name.
