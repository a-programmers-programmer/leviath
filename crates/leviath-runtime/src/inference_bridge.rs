//! The async worker side of the ECS inference stage - the sync-ECS ↔ async-I/O
//! bridge for inference.
//!
//! Systems can't `.await`, and a single inference can take up to an hour, so the
//! inference-dispatch system never runs the network call itself. Instead it
//! builds an [`InferenceJob`] (an agent's request plus the per-model pool permit
//! it acquired) and `tokio::spawn`s [`run_inference_job`]. That short-lived task
//! performs the call with the permit held, reports an [`InferenceOutcome`] on the
//! results channel, and wakes the tick loop; the inference-collect system drains
//! outcomes on a later tick and applies them back to the agents.
//!
//! One task exists per *in-flight request* (bounded by the per-model
//! [`InferencePools`](crate::inference_pool::InferencePools) permits), **never**
//! one per agent - that is what keeps CPU bounded by work, not by agent count.
