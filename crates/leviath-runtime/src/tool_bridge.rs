//! The async worker side of the ECS tool stage - the sync-ECS ↔ async-I/O
//! bridge for tool execution.
//!
//! When the pipeline decides an agent's response has tool calls to run, the
//! tool-dispatch system builds a [`ToolJob`] (the agent plus a boxed async
//! closure that executes that agent's batch of calls against its own tool
//! registry / workdir / policy) and sends it to the tool lane. The lane runs the
//! batch and reports its [`ToolOutcome`] back on the results channel, waking the
//! tick loop; the tool-collect system applies the results on a later tick.
//!
//! **Concurrency**: the lane is a *semaphore*, not a pool of workers.
//! [`ToolLane::serve`] reads jobs off the channel and spawns one task per batch;
//! each task holds a permit for as long as it is executing, so
//! `max_concurrent_tools` batches run at a time.
//!
//! A fixed pool of worker tasks cannot do this job. Several things a batch can
//! await have no time bound at all: a tool-approval prompt, an `ask_user`, a
//! `wait_for_agent` poll that only ends when some other run finishes. A worker
//! sitting in one of those is a unit of capacity spent on waiting rather than
//! working, and a parent waiting on a child it spawned holds the capacity that
//! child needs to finish. Enough of those and no agent's tools run again for
//! the life of the daemon.
//!
//! A permit, unlike a worker, can be handed back in the middle of a batch. That
//! is what [`off_lane`] does, and it is what makes the deadlock impossible:
//! waiting costs the lane nothing, and the batch takes a permit again when it has
//! something to do.
//!
//! **Order**: which of two batches submitted together gets in first is not
//! fixed - they race for the permit as separate tasks. Nothing depends on it,
//! since an agent only ever has one batch in flight, and once both are actually
//! waiting the semaphore hands out permits first-come-first-served, so nothing
//! is starved either.
