/// The failure this guards against: an agent can read and reason about a

/// with no output. A `require_modifications` gate keeps it in the stage until it
/// has actually written something.
///
/// The gate passes when any of these hold:
/// - the stage advertises no file-modifying tool (it could never pass, so gating
///   it would only burn iterations);
/// - a modifying tool call succeeded in this stage;
/// - one was refused by the permission layer (the agent is trying and cannot);
/// - the gate names a region and that region is non-empty (the durable signal:
///   per-stage counters don't survive a daemon restart, but regions do).
///
/// When the gate's re-run budget is spent it gives up loudly, as
/// [`GateDecision::Forced`].
