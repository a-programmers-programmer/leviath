//! Per-provider circuit breakers: stop hammering a provider that has told us,
//! repeatedly, that it cannot serve anyone.
//!
//! Failing over (see [`super::response::collect_inference`]) rescues one run.
//! It does nothing for the *next* run, which starts on the same dead provider
//! and burns its own failure discovering the same thing. At scale that is ten
//! consecutive workers, every one of them dying at iteration 0 against an
//! OpenRouter account with no credits left.
//!
//! So failures are counted per provider. Past a threshold the circuit opens and
//! dispatch stops choosing that provider at all, which turns a silent stream of
//! dead runs into one visible state an operator can act on (`lev ps`, the
//! `leviath.provider.circuit.open` gauge, and a `tracing::error!`).
//!
//! There is no half-open *state*, on purpose. `is_open` simply stops answering
//! true once the cooldown has elapsed, so the next dispatch is the probe: it
//! either succeeds and closes the circuit, or fails and re-opens it with a
//! fresh timestamp. One less state machine to keep correct.
