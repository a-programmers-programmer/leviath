//! Correcting the window's estimate against what the provider actually charged.
//!
//! The context window sizes everything it holds with
//! [`leviath_core::estimate_tokens`], which is bytes divided by four. That is a
//! guess, and it is a guess in a place where being wrong is expensive: region
//! budgets, the eviction trigger and the output cap are all decided against it,
//! and on a provider whose window is a hard ceiling the arithmetic being a few
//! percent light is the difference between a run that finishes and a run that
//! dies.
//!
//! The guess is also correctable, because every response says what the request
//! really cost. `prompt_tokens` comes back from the server's own tokenizer on
//! every call and is already journaled. Comparing it against what the window
//! believed the same request would cost gives the drift directly, so the
//! runtime does not have to guess better - it only has to listen.
//!
//! What is measured is end-to-end rather than a pure tokenizer ratio: the
//! reported figure covers the tool schemas and the hint blocks as well as the
//! regions, and those cost just as much. What the eviction trigger needs is one
//! number carrying "what the window thinks it holds" over to "what the provider
//! will charge", and that is what this keeps.
//!
//! Two properties keep this from being a trade:
//!
//! * It only ever tightens. A provider that charges less than the estimate -
//!   which is the common case, since `len()` counts bytes and any non-ASCII
//!   text inflates the estimate - leaves the correction at zero and changes
//!   nothing at all. Nobody's usable context shrinks unless their provider was
//!   measured charging more than the runtime believed.
//! * It only engages on measured evidence. There is no margin here, no
//!   guessed percentage held back from every workload on the chance that some
//!   of them drift. Until a call is observed costing more, the arithmetic is
//!   exactly what it was.
//!
//! The failure this exists for: a 27B model pinned to `num_ctx 32768` assembles
//! 32,497 real tokens on a Python-heavy corpus while the estimator believes it
//! is inside the region budgets. The next call appends three more read results,
//! crosses the window, and Ollama front-truncates from the start - taking the
//! last user turn with it and answering `no user query found in messages`,
//! which names neither the size nor the truncation.
