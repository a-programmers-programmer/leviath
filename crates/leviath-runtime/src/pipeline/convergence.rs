//! Telling a looping stage what its last visit actually produced.
//!
//! A stage that loops - `analyze` sending itself back to `gather`, `compare`
//! back to `survey` - has no idea how much its previous pass added, because
//! every visit starts against the same accumulated context and looks equally
//! productive from the inside. Measured on one run, `analyze` re-read 4.76M
//! input tokens across its visits to produce 47K of output: a hundred tokens
//! in for every one out, which is what a stage re-reading everything to add
//! almost nothing looks like.
//!
//! The counters already available do not catch it. `max_revisits` and the
//! `stuck` thresholds are both budgets, and a budget ends a stage whether or
//! not it was still finding things - it cuts off the productive pass and the
//! wasted one alike. What decides whether another pass is worth running is not
//! how many have run, it is whether the last one added anything.
//!
//! So this measures the yield of each visit and hands the number back on
//! re-entry. The model is not asked to introspect about whether it is making
//! progress, which is exactly the kind of question a confident model answers
//! wrongly: it is told what the last pass added, and the stage's transition
//! prompt names the edge to take when that is little. A stage still turning up
//! material keeps looping, and nothing is capped.
//!
//! ## What counts as progress
//!
//! The regions a blueprint marks `volatility = "grows"` - documented as "a
//! findings list, a bibliography, a transcript of what has been read". That is
//! already exactly the accumulating evidence, so no blueprint needs new
//! configuration to opt in, and a blueprint that marks nothing gets no note
//! rather than a wrong one.
