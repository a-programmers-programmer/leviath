//! Running a stage's script hooks.
//!
//! The contract lives in [`leviath_scripting::stage_hook`]; this module is the
//! pipeline half - when each hook fires, what the script is shown, and what
//! each outcome does to the agent.
//!
//! # Where `on_stage_enter` fires
//!
//! On the [`StageJustEntered`] marker the transition systems already set, and
//! **before** `sync_tool_stages`, which consumes it. That puts the hook after
//! the stage's layout and system prompt are in place (so it can read and write
//! real regions) and before the first inference of the stage is built (so what
//! it writes is in the request).
//!
//! Firing off a marker rather than inside `enter_stage` is deliberate:
//! `enter_stage` is a pure function called from three places, and threading the
//! compiled scripts plus an error channel through all of them would put script
//! execution in the middle of a transition. Here it is one system, one query,
//! and the failure modes stay at the tick boundary.
