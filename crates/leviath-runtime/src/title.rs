//! Run-title generation.
//!
//! The dashboard displays, searches, and persists `RunMetadata.title`; this
//! module is what fills it in. At spawn, the daemon marks an eligible run
//! [`PendingTitle`] and hands it a [`TitleCandidates`] chain; `dispatch_title`
//! makes one cheap LLM call over the task prompt via the `title_bridge` worker,
//! and `collect_title` sanitizes the reply into the metadata. Everything
//! downstream (persistence, dashboard header, run search) already reads the
//! field.
//!
//! Best-effort, in that nothing here ever fails a run: a run with no name shows
//! the task the user typed instead. It is not, however, one shot at one
//! provider any more. The call retries a transient refusal on the dispatch
//! lane's schedule, and a call that fails outright moves to the next candidate
//! - the same chain stage inference fails over along.
//!
//! That last part is the fix for a failure worth describing, because every
//! decision in it was individually reasonable. Titling took the head of the
//! run's model chain, called it once, and on any error wrote the reason to
//! `tracing::debug!` - in a daemon whose stdout goes to `/dev/null`. So when an
//! account went over its limit on one gateway, every stage of every run
//! completed (stage inference retried, then failed over) while the runs
//! themselves came out nameless, with nothing anywhere saying why. The lane now
//! retries, fails over, and records what stopped it in
//! [`RunMetadata::title_error`](crate::persistence::RunMetadata::title_error).
//!
//! Retrying makes a title *later*, which brought a second failure into view: a
//! terminal run is unloaded from memory a pass after it finishes, and a title
//! landing on an unloaded run was dropped, reason and all. A run making two
//! provider calls finishes well inside one title call, so it lost even a single
//! 50ms retry. The host now holds a finished run resident while the title lane
//! still has a live claim on it (see `title_outstanding`), the claim is
//! bounded by [`TITLE_JOB_BUDGET_SECS`] so nothing is held long, and the
//! persistence lane treats a landed name as worth a write - without which the
//! title reached the entity and never reached disk.
//!
//! What still stops the attempt without a second opinion is a call that
//! *completed* and produced nothing usable: an empty reply, or one cut off at
//! the token limit. A reasoning model spends output tokens working up to its
//! answer, so a starved budget returns nothing but working-out - and the
//! OpenAI-shaped parsers promote that into `content` when the answer itself is
//! empty. The title call asks the provider not to think, gives it room in case
//! it does anyway, and stores nothing at all rather than the model's thoughts
//! about what a title should be. Paying a second provider to have that same
//! opinion would buy nothing.
