//! Handling for the `submit_output` tool: an agent handing back its answer.
//!
//! Applied inline by the tool-dispatch pipeline system rather than on the async
//! tool lane, for the same reason the `context_*` tools are: it writes to the
//! live [`ContextWindow`] and to an ECS component, neither of which the lane can
//! reach. `handle_output_tool` is the pure core that system calls.
//!
//! # What this does not do
//!
//! It does not interpret the format. A submission asking for a2ui, XML, CSV, or
//! anything else is recorded byte for byte; the label travels alongside it for
//! consumers to dispatch on, and nothing here reads it.
//!
//! The one exception is opt-in: when the resolved [`OutputSpec`] carries a JSON
//! Schema, the submission is parsed and validated, and a failure is refused back
//! to the model as an `[error] …` result so the next turn can correct it. That
//! refusal path is deliberately the same shape as the dispatch layer's Layer 2
//! argument refusal, down to the `[error]` prefix, which is already in the
//! no-effect list and so keeps a rejected submission from counting as work.
//!
