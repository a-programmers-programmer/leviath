//! The local control transport: newline-delimited JSON
//! [`ControlRequest`]/[`ControlResponse`] frames between clients (the TUI/CLI)
//! and the world host, over a platform-native local socket.
//!
//! The wire protocol and its dispatch to the host are transport-agnostic and
//! live here; the actual socket is provided per platform so each uses its native,
//! access-controlled local IPC:
//!
//! - **Unix** → a Unix-domain socket (a filesystem path, guarded by file perms).
//! - **Windows** → a named pipe (`\\.\pipe\…`, guarded by its security
//!   descriptor).
//!
//! Each platform module exposes the same small surface - [`ControlId`],
//! [`control_id`], [`bind_control_listener`], [`ControlListener::accept`],
//! `connect`, and [`is_daemon_running`] - over which the shared
//! `handle_connection` (generic over any `AsyncRead + AsyncWrite`) and
//! [`ControlClient`] operate. It is the default, always-on management channel
//! (the opt-in HTTP API that `lev serve` toggles is a separate surface).

/// the Windows control channel served *every* connection it accepted: anyone who
/// could reach the pipe could spawn a tool-executing agent and answer its
/// approval prompts.
///
/// A token closes that without any of the FFI. The daemon writes a fresh random
/// secret into its own directory, readable only by the owner, and refuses any
/// connection that cannot quote it. A caller who can read the file is a caller
/// who can already read `config.toml` - so the token grants nothing that was not
/// already reachable, which is exactly the property wanted.
///
/// It is required on every platform, not only Windows. One protocol is easier to
