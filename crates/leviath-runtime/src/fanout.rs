//! The fan-out engine: many sub-agents at once, and their results together.
//!
//! # One engine, two entry points
//!
//! Both start at `begin_fan_out`, which parks the parent in [`FanOutWaiting`].
//! `fan_out_collect` then starts one worker per item - bounded by
//! `max_workers` - through the daemon-installed [`FanOutSpawner`], tracks them
//! as the parent's `SubAgentChildren`, and once every worker is terminal applies
//! the failure policy and builds the consolidated report.
//!
//! What differs is only how that report is delivered, which is exactly what
//! [`FanOutOrigin`] records:
//!
//! - **The [`FAN_OUT_TOOL`] tool**, callable from any stage that grants it. The
//!   dispatcher reads the call (`parse_fan_out_call`), hands it over as
//!   `PendingFanOut`, and `start_pending_fan_outs` begins it. The report
//!   comes back as that call's tool result, routed by the stage's
//!   `tool_routing` like any other, and the agent carries on where it was.
//! - **A `mode = "fan_out"` stage** (see
//!   [`leviath_core::blueprint::StageMode::FanOut`]), which is sugar for
//!   granting the same tool: its report goes to the config's `results_region`
//!   and the stage transitions to its `merge_stage`.
//!
//! Because both park the same way, both survive a daemon restart through
//! `fanout.json` (see [`FanOutState`]).
//!
//! # What lives elsewhere
//!
//! The runtime only **starts and tracks** workers; resolving *which* blueprint a
//! worker runs (self-at-worker-stage, a named agent, or a capability query) is
//! the CLI's job, encapsulated behind the [`FanOutSpawner`] it installs.
//!
//! A single sub-agent is `spawn_agent`, not a fan-out of one.
//!
