//! The async I/O lane for agent-state persistence.
//!
//! The snapshot-dispatch system builds a [`PersistJob`] (an agent's `meta.json` +
//! `context.json` value snapshot) whenever the agent meaningfully changes and
//! sends it to this single-worker lane. [`persistence_worker`] writes each job's
//! files under `<runs_dir>/<run_id>/` **one at a time**, so writes for a given
//! agent never race or land out of order. Each file is written to a temp path and
//! atomically renamed into place, so a concurrent reader (the dashboard) never
//! sees a half-written file. All errors are logged and swallowed - persistence is
//! best-effort and must never stall or fail the world.
