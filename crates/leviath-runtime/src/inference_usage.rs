//! What one provider call cost, recorded where it lands.
//!
//! A run bills for four kinds of call and, until this module existed, counted
//! one of them. Stage turns went into [`TokenTotals`];
//! the compaction, title, and routing lanes each threw their usage away at the
//! outcome boundary, because each channel carried only the payload its collector
//! wanted - a summary, a title, a stage name - and usage was not it.
//!
//! Two things follow from putting the accounting in one place rather than
//! repeating it per lane. The cumulative totals finally cover every call, so a
//! run's reported spend is what the provider actually billed. And each call
//! writes a [`RunRecord::InferenceUsage`] as it lands, which is the part
//! [`RunRecord::Progress`] cannot do: progress counters are cumulative, so two
//! calls between two ticks arrive as their sum, and a chart of that sum shows a
//! spike no single call ever made.
