//! A provider for any server that speaks the OpenAI chat API.
//!
//! llama.cpp, vLLM, LM Studio, LocalAI, and most gateways answer
//! `POST /chat/completions` and `GET /models` in OpenAI's shape, and until now
//! reaching one from Leviath meant writing a Rhai provider script for a wire
//! format this crate already implements twice. This is the third use of
//! the crate-private OpenAI compatibility module, with nothing vendor-specific on top: no compiled
//! model table, no pricing, no cache markers, just the request, the stream and
//! the listing.
//!
//! What it knows about a model it learns from the server. `GET /models` fills
//! the catalogue at priming; a server that will not list (some gateways refuse
//! the route, llama.cpp before a model is loaded answers an empty list) falls
//! back to the ids the config named, and with neither it says nothing rather
//! than guessing, so a blueprint that pins a model on it is never refused.
