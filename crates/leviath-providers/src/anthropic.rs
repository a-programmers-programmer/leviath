///
/// One number for every Anthropic model rather than a per-model table.
/// 1024 is the documented Sonnet and Opus floor and Haiku's is higher, so this
/// is the permissive bound: on Haiku a marker that clears it may still be
/// declined, which costs nothing beyond the slot. A name-keyed table would be
/// the alternative and is the shape of thing that goes stale silently - the

/// documents this as roughly twenty. So a marker further past the previous
/// request's entry than this never finds it, however byte-identical the prefix
/// is - the request reads nothing and rewrites the conversation at 1.25x.
///
/// This is what makes a marker that rolls forward with the conversation
/// collapse rather than merely drift: a workload appending a dozen content
/// blocks a turn outruns the lookback within a few turns and never gets back
/// inside it. Measured across a run: reads climbed while the gap stayed at or

/// request. A fourth system marker can only ever cover less than that.

/// a marker at "20 blocks in" is at the same place next request, so the entry it
/// wrote is looked up exactly where it was left. A marker placed relative to the
/// end moves every turn by however much the turn appended, and once that step
/// exceeds [`CACHE_LOOKBACK_BLOCKS`] the lookup can no longer reach the previous
/// entry - which is an absorbing state, because the step does not shrink.
///
/// Anchoring also keeps the markers continuous as the conversation grows. Going
/// from 45 blocks to 57 leaves the stride multiples at 16 and 32 exactly where
/// they were; crossing 48 adds one at 48 and keeps the earlier two. There is
/// always a marker sitting on an entry that already exists.

/// when there are more than fit, because they cover the most conversation - and

/// **A marker on content that changes is waste.** The entry it creates can never

/// construction. Without this the sole marker can sit on a six-token status
/// line at the end of the system array, making the whole prompt uncacheable.
///
/// **Several markers cost nothing extra and find the longest match.** The API
/// takes up to four and reads back the longest stored prefix that still
/// matches, so spreading them is free insurance: if the newest block changed,
/// an earlier marker still hits. Spending one marker of four, which is what this
/// did before, threw that away. The *last* candidates are kept rather than an
/// even spread, because the longest prefix is the most valuable and the ones
/// just behind it are the fallbacks that matter - a region of twenty chunks
/// whose tail moves wants markers near the tail, not near the head.
///
/// Volatility comes from the blueprint and the hint from the region's kind, and

/// rewrites a region, and the runtime knows that it clears a `Temporary` one
