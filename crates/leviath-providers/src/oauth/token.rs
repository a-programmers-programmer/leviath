//! Holding a bearer token that expires, and replacing it exactly once.
//!
//! A subscription grant rotates: every refresh mints a new refresh token and
//! invalidates the one presented. Presenting a spent refresh token is not a
//! retryable error, it is the end of the grant, and the user has to sign in
//! through a browser again. That single fact shapes everything here.
//!
//! Leviath runs up to eight inferences per model concurrently. When a token
//! lapses they do not fail one at a time, they fail together, so a naive
//! "notice the 401, refresh, retry" would fire eight refreshes against one
//! grant and poison it. Guarding with a plain mutex is not enough either: eight
//! tasks queue on the lock and each still concludes, correctly at the time it
//! checked, that a refresh is needed.
//!
//! So [`TokenSource::refresh_stale`] takes *the token that failed*. Under the
//! lock it compares that against what is cached now, and a caller whose stale
//! token has already been replaced gets the replacement instead of a second
//! network round trip. Proactive refresh routes through the same call with the
//! currently-cached token, so early and reactive refresh cannot race each other
//! either.
//!
//! Across processes the same shape is repeated with a lock file and a re-read
//! from disk, because a daemon and an ad-hoc `lev run` hold separate caches
//! over one grant file.
