//! Putting a streamed answer back together.

//! The runtime asks for a whole turn: an agent cannot act on half a sentence,
//! so nothing downstream ever sees a partial answer. Streaming is here for the
//! socket, not for the agent - a buffered call sends nothing back until the
//! model has finished thinking, and a connection that has been silent for
//! minutes is one that a NAT, a VPN or a corporate proxy will close as dead.
//!
//! So this module is the exact inverse of the default
//! [`Provider::infer_stream`](super::Provider::infer_stream), which takes a
//! finished response apart into one chunk.
