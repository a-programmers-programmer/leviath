/// Default wall-clock deadline, in seconds, for a single inference call when a
/// stage doesn't set its own `request_timeout_secs`.
///
/// This is the one unified inference timeout. It bounds every provider call the
/// same way: HTTP providers apply it as a per-request total timeout (see
/// [`apply_request_timeout`]), the claude-code provider as its subprocess
/// timeout, and the dispatch layer as the `RetryPolicy.job_timeout` backstop
/// that frees the pool slot even if a provider's own timer is defeated (e.g. by
/// trickle keep-alive). 15 minutes is generous for any real inference -
/// including large-prompt Anthropic cache creation, which can take several
/// minutes to first byte - while still guaranteeing a hung call cannot run
/// forever. A per-stage `[stages.<name>.model] request_timeout_secs` overrides
/// it, so a slow stage can wait longer and a fast one can fail sooner.
///
/// It is also [`build_http_client`]'s fallback when the config sets no global
/// `request_timeout_secs`, so side-channel calls that bypass the dispatch
/// backstop (title generation, compaction) are still bounded - a hung one
/// held its pool permit forever, observed live against Gemini. Precedence,
/// most specific wins: stage `request_timeout_secs` (per-request, overrides
/// the client's) > config `request_timeout_secs` (client-level) > this
/// default (client-level, only when the config is unset - it can never cap a
/// configured value).

///   (confirmed via `curl`: a 40KB POST on a fresh connection returns HTTP 200,
///   and small requests, which don't trigger the stall, share the pool fine).
///   It is transport-independent - it reproduces over both HTTP/2 and HTTP/1.1 -
///   so forcing a fresh connection per request, not the protocol, is the fix.
///   The cost is a TLS handshake per request, negligible for the sequential
