//! What this route serves, and which plans can reach it.
//!
//! There is no `/models` endpoint here, so the catalog is compiled in the way
//! the Claude Code transport's is. Two consequences worth stating rather than
//! discovering: the context windows are this build's belief and cannot be
//! checked against the server, and the reachable set depends on the account's
//! ChatGPT plan.
//!
//! Percentage region budgets resolve once at spawn against
//! [`ModelCapabilities::max_context_tokens`], so a wrong row here silently
//! mis-sizes every region for a whole run - which is exactly what happened:
//! every model carried 400,000, a figure no vendor publishes for any of them,
//! and a `gpt-5.5` run used 38% of the window it had for months.
//!
//! The windows are OpenAI's published `max_input_tokens`, cross-checked
//! against OpenRouter's `context_length` (which is the whole window, and
//! larger by exactly the output allowance). Whether the Codex *route* caps
//! lower than the API is not knowable from here - it publishes no catalogue -
//! so these assume it does not. If it turns out to, the symptom is a refused
//! request rather than a silent one, and `[model_capabilities]` is the lever.
//!
//! `cargo xtask prices` re-checks these against the published figures every
//! week and reports a row that has drifted. It never rewrites them.
