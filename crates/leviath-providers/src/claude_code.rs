//! Claude Code CLI provider.
//!
//! Uses the `claude` CLI as a plain inference transport so a user with a Claude
//! subscription can run Leviath without an API key.
//!
//! The CLI is driven as a *relay*, not as an agent: its own tools, settings
//! files, MCP servers and slash commands are all switched off, Leviath's
//! assembled system blocks become the entire system prompt, and tool calling
//! rides the text protocol in `text_tools`. Leviath keeps ownership of
//! the context window, the tool loop, and the iteration count.
//!
//! **Flags that matter, and why:**
//! - No `--bare`. It looks like the right lockdown switch, but it documents
//!   itself as "Anthropic auth is strictly ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or apiKeyHelper -
//!   OAuth and keychain are never read", so under a subscription every call
//!   fails with `Not logged in · Please run /login`. Every mechanism that
//!   suppresses the CLI's injected context also disables OAuth; the two are
//!   mutually exclusive.
//! - No `--allowed-tools`. Leviath tool names passed there would ask *Claude
//!   Code* to run *its own* tools under those names, and the results would never
//!   reach Leviath.
//! - `--system-prompt-file` rather than `--system-prompt`: an assembled context
//!   can be hundreds of kilobytes, well past Linux's 128 KB per-argument limit.
//!   The prompt goes on stdin for the same reason.
//! - `--effort` is always passed explicitly. Left alone the CLI picks `high`
//!   with adaptive thinking, spending output tokens and latency Leviath never
//!   asked for.
//!
//! **Limitations compared to a direct API provider:**
//! - The CLI adds ~130 tokens of its own context to every call - a billing
//!   header, an identity line, the current date, and (on the OAuth path) the
//!   user's account email address. None of it can be disabled.
//! - No prompt caching: each call is a fresh process with a fresh session.
//! - ~200 ms process-spawn overhead per inference.
//! - Anthropic models only, and the CLI ignores the request's `max_tokens` and
//!   `temperature` in favour of its own.
