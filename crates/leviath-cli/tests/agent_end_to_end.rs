//! One real agent, driven through one real tool call, by the real host.
//!
//! Everything below this file is production: `build_host` builds the same
//! `WorldHost` the daemon runs, the same `ControlOp::Spawn` path loads the
//! blueprint and registers per-agent tool state, and the same pipeline systems
//! dispatch the inference, execute the tool, and resolve the transition. Only
//! two things are substituted, and both are the outside world: the provider,
//! and the clock.
//!
//! # Why this file exists
//!
//! The unit tests cover each of those systems, and they were all green while
//! several bugs shipped that only a whole run could show: a fan-out reporting
//! ten empty sections as successes, a stage advertising no tools so a policy
//! test passed vacuously, an unanswered checkpoint approved on timeout. Each was
//! found by driving a live daemon by hand, and each time that evidence
//! evaporated with the terminal session. This is the cheapest permanent form of
//! it.
//!
//! # Why in-process rather than a spawned daemon
//!
//! A spawned binary would add a socket, a process, and a poll loop, and the poll
//! loop is where flake lives. `run_until_idle` is wake-driven and bounded, so
//! this test has no sleeps, no timeouts, and no polling: it either reaches a
//! fixed point or it fails. What a spawned daemon would additionally prove is
//! the socket transport, which `control_socket` already tests directly.
