//! Leviath CLI library - re-exports for integration tests.
//!
//! `missing_docs` applies here like everywhere else in the workspace. This crate
//! ships the `lev` binary rather than a library anyone calls, so the case for
//! exempting it was real - and the case against turned out to be stronger: the
//! `pub` surface is what the integration tests drive, and a wire type like
//! `commands::serve::ServerEvent` is read by clients that never see this
//! source. An undocumented field there is a gap for somebody.
//!
//! What the rule asks for is a sentence saying something the name does not. A
//! clap `Args` field already carries its user-facing text for `--help`; the
//! struct around it says which command it belongs to.
