List agent runs in the shared-world daemon.

Columns: RUN, STATUS, STAGE (with position when the blueprint has several),
ITER (iterations in the current stage), TOOLS (tool calls so far), and the three
time columns AGE, WORK and MOVED.

TITLE sits after RUN when at least one listed run has a generated title, on the
same terms as READS below: a column nobody can fill costs every reader width and
buys them nothing.

READS appears only when some listed run's blueprint declares [read_paths], and
reads granted/declared. A blueprint declaring paths outside its workdir is not
the same as being allowed to read them: your config.toml has to grant them too,
so `0/2` means the run is up and every such read will be refused. `lev validate
<agent>` names the entries and prints the stanza to add.

Three time columns, because a run can look very different under each and the
difference is usually what you are trying to see - alive for an hour, at work for
ten minutes of it, and holding a prompt open for the rest:

AGE is how long since the run was launched. It says nothing about whether the run
has done anything.

WORK is how long the run actually spent working: inferring, calling tools, or
held for its own fan-out workers and sub-agents. The clock stops for everything
that is not the run's doing - paused, blocked on a person, parked until the
machine is fixed, finished - so this, not AGE, is the run's duration.

MOVED is how long since the run last actually moved - a new iteration, a new
stage, or a change of status. It is not the `updated_at` in meta.json, which
also advances on a 30-second heartbeat and so stays fresh on a wedged run. This
column was headed AGE before; a script reading the table should read --json,
where every row carries `age_secs` and `working_secs` computed and the raw stamps
beside them.

Statuses:
  active     running a turn, or waiting on the model or a tool
  idle       spawned, not yet started
  paused     paused with `lev pause`; resume with `lev resume`
  waiting    blocked - see the reason after the colon
  complete   finished
  cancelled  cancelled with `lev kill`
  error      ended with the error shown

A finished run marked `(no output)` changed no files, though its agent had a
tool to change them with. Usually the work went through the shell, which the
framework cannot see: edits made with `sed -i`, `tee` or a redirect are not
recorded, so re-apply them with `edit_file` or `write_file`. Agents that never
had a file-writing tool - a router, a researcher - are never marked this way.

A `waiting` run says what it is blocked on. These need a person:
  tool approval  a tool call needs approving; answer with `lev respond`
  user prompt    the agent asked a question (ask_user_*); answer it
  taint gate     a call needs clearance for the data it touches
  checkpoint     a blueprint stage-boundary review

These do not - the run is parked on other work and resumes by itself:
  workers(n)     a fan-out parent, n workers still to finish
  children(n)    a stage holding for n spawned sub-agents

So `waiting: children(3)` alongside busy children is a healthy factory, while
`waiting: tool approval` is stopped until someone answers. Run with `--yolo` to
approve automatically, including for sub-agents and fan-out workers.

A run stays listed for a few minutes after it finishes, so a script polling on
an interval learns how a run ended rather than finding it gone. Set
`[limits] finished_retention_secs` to change the window, or 0 to drop a run the
moment it finishes. The record is held in memory, so a daemon restart clears it;
`meta.json` and the REST API keep the durable copy.

An `out of service` block under the table lists providers the daemon has stopped
sending work to, because each failed several times in a row for something only
you can fix: an account out of credits, or a key that was rejected. Runs move to
the next provider a stage lists (or one from `[providers] fallback_order`); a run
with none left is failed rather than left waiting. Each entry says how long until
that provider is tried again, and topping up the account needs no restart.

A `lanes:` line under the table means the daemon itself is worth a look. It
shows the tool lane's occupancy - batches running, parked on a wait, and queued
behind them - and, if the daemon has stopped getting anywhere, how many re-drive
cycles it has gone without a single run moving. A run parked on a wait costs the
lane nothing, so `parked` is not a problem on its own; `queued` with no progress
is.

--json prints {\"runs\": [...], \"finished\": [...], \"health\": {...}}, keeping
finished runs apart from the ones the daemon is still hosting. A row's
\"has_final_output\" says whether the agent handed something back; read the
answer itself with `lev result <run-id>` (it can be large, so it is not
inlined here). Every row carries \"age_secs\" and \"working_secs\" already
computed, the same two keys the HTTP API serves, plus the raw \"started_at\",
\"last_progress_at\" and \"active\" they come from.

--all adds a NOT RUNNING block, read from the runs dir rather than the daemon's
memory. The retention window above covers the minutes after a run ends; this
covers the rest of time, and survives a daemon restart. A row marked
`(abandoned)` claims on disk to be running, is not held by the daemon, and has
not moved in five minutes - clear it with `lev cancel --force <run-id>`.

With --all the daemon being down is reported rather than fatal, and nothing is
marked abandoned in that case, because an unreachable daemon looks exactly like
every run dying at once. --all --json adds \"daemon_reachable\" and
\"not_running\"; without --all the JSON is unchanged. Reading the runs dir costs
a file per run and nothing prunes it, so poll --all less often than plain ps.";
