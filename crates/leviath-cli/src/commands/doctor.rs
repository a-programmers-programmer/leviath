//! `lev doctor` - prove the provider wiring works, one layer at a time.
//!
//! Five checks run in order and each one is reported, so a failure names the
//! layer that broke instead of leaving the caller to guess:
//!
//! 1. `config` - the config file parses and a provider registry can be built.
//! 2. `search` - the bundled research agents can reach a search engine. The odd
//!    one out: it warns rather than fails, and it asks the *daemon* what it can
//!    see rather than inspecting this process, because the daemon's environment
//!    is fixed at exec time and is not the shell `doctor` was typed in.
//! 3. `resolve` - the user's defaults pick a provider that is actually
//!    registered. This is the check that catches a stage resolving to
//!    `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6` (the hard-coded last resort in
//!    [`ModelConfig::provider`](leviath_core::blueprint::ModelConfig::provider))
//!    on a machine with no Anthropic key - the root cause of a fleet of runs
//!    that spawned, sat at iteration 0, and never took a turn.
//! 4. `inference` - one real call to that provider, straight through
//!    [`Provider::infer`]. No world, no run, nothing on disk.
//! 5. `daemon` - a throwaway one-stage agent spawned over the control socket
//!    and waited on, then deleted. This is the only check that exercises the
//!    handoff, which is why it is worth the second billed call: checks 1-4
//!    passing while this one fails is exactly the "credentials are fine, the
//!    daemon is wedged" verdict, which nothing short of a real spawn
//!    establishes.
//!
//! The daemon-touching I/O lives behind [`crate::dispatch::RiskyExecutors`], so
//! the cores here are driven by unit tests against injected registries and a
//! scripted control socket. The registry builder is a `&dyn Fn` rather than a
//! generic for the coverage reason documented on
//! `crate::commands::models`'s equivalent seam.

Check that provider wiring works, end to end.

Five checks run in order, and the first failure stops the rest. The check that
fails is the diagnosis:

  config     the config file parses and a provider registry can be built.
             Fails on a malformed config.toml.
  search     the bundled research agents can reach a search engine. Asks the
             daemon what it can see, not this shell, since only the daemon's
             environment decides. Warns (never fails) when BRAVE_API_KEY is
             unset, when the daemon was started before it existed, or when it
             is missing from [security] allow_env_vars - each of which silently
             downgrades every web_search to a keyless Wikipedia lookup.
  resolve    your default provider/model picks a provider that is actually
             registered. Fails when a key is missing or misspelled - and
             catches the case where a blueprint with no model falls back to
             anthropic on a machine that has no Anthropic key.
  inference  one real call to that provider. Fails on a bad key, an unknown
             model id, or a billing problem; the provider's own error is
             printed verbatim, status line and response body included.
  daemon     a one-stage agent spawned over the control socket, waited on,
             then deleted. Fails when the handoff is broken even though the
             credentials are fine.

So config/resolve/inference OK with daemon FAIL means the daemon is the
problem, not your keys - the distinction this command exists to make.

`--model` takes the same forms `lev run --model` does: `provider/model` picks
both (the way to reach a Rhai script provider by name), and a bare model id
pairs with your default_provider. Use it to try a model string before wiring it
into a blueprint.

Two inferences are billed per run, capped at 64 output tokens each.
`--no-daemon` stops after the third check and bills one.

Exits non-zero on failure, so it works as a CI gate. --json prints the same
checks as {\"checks\": [...], \"passed\": bool}.";
