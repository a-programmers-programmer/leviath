//! agent actually concluded lived nowhere a shell could reach it - the only
//! surface serving it was `GET /api/agents/{id}/result`, which needed a running
//! `lev serve`.
//!
//! Read-only and daemon-free: everything comes from the run's `meta.json`, so
//! this answers for a run that finished last week as readily as one that
//! finished a second ago.
