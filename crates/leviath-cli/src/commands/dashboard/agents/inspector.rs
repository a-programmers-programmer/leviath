//!
//! A field that does not apply is disabled rather than hidden, so the panel
//! never reflows under the cursor: the fan-out rows are there on every
//! stage and greyed until the mode is `fan_out`; the hint row is there on

//! panels are the same lists of fields, drawn by the same code, opened over
//! the panel they came from and closed with Esc.
