//! The detail view's graph band: the run's path through its blueprint, drawn
//! in the rows the flat tab strip otherwise takes, by the same canvas as the
//! explorer.
//!
//! The strip says "3 of 7" and which stage is selected. The band says where
//! the run has actually been: one box per stage *visit*, in order, snaking
//! across rows so it stays compact and grows a row at a time while the run is
//! still going (see [`crate::tui::flowgraph::path`]). Three passes through
//! `implement` are three boxes - `implement`, `implement (2)`,
//! `implement (3)` - not one with a `×3` badge, because the order is the
//! story. Painting the run onto the whole blueprint instead answers a
//! different question ("what could it do"), and buries this one in the
//! stages it never went near.
//!
//! The blueprint is still a keypress away: `t` swaps the band to it and back,
//! and `g` opens it full screen. The selection on the canvas is the stage
//! tab: `←`/`→` move it along the path, `1`-`9` jump to a stage by number, a
//! click picks a box, and the content panes below follow. Boxes drag and the
//! canvas pans; `R` re-snakes, throwing away an arrangement made by hand. On
//! a terminal too short to give it its rows the strip stays.
