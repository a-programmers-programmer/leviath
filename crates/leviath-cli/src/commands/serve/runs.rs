//! `GET /api/runs` - the paginated, searchable run listing.
//!
//! Supersedes `GET /api/agents`, which returns every run ever recorded as one
//! unbounded array and accepts only a status filter. That route stays exactly as
//! it is, deprecated: it is the legacy spelling (the console says "runs"
//! everywhere), and it gets a replacement at a new path rather than a changed
//! response shape, so nothing that calls it today breaks.
//!
//! What this adds over that: keyset pagination, sorting, server-side search with
//! highlights, batch fetch by id, and field projection.
//!
//! **What it does not fix.** Every listing here still walks the runs directory
//! and parses every `meta.json`, because that is the only index there is.
//! Pagination bounds what crosses the wire and what the browser holds; it does
//! not bound the server's work. The guard that does bound the damage is
//! [`MAX_SEARCH_SCAN`], on the filesystem-reading half of search.
//!
//! Pruning is [`delete_run`] and [`delete_runs`], which is the other half of
//! that story: the listing can now be made smaller, not only paged over.
