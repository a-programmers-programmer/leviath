//! Read and write the Rhai scripts a machine runs.
//!
//! Six extension points share one API because they share one editor: a script
//! tool, a region hook, a stage hook, an output validator, a mime check and a
//! model provider are all a `.rhai` file somewhere under the home directory,
//! and only the `kind` says which compiler has to accept it.
//!
//! # Where each kind actually lives
//!
//! Only **script tools** have a directory convention an agent owns:
//! `<agent>/tools/*.rhai`, scanned at spawn, plus the global `~/.leviath/tools/`
//! every agent gets. The hooks and the validator are named by path in the
//! manifest and resolved relative to the agent's own directory, with
//! `resolve_*_scripts` in the daemon refusing any that lands outside it. There
//! is no `hooks/` or `validators/` directory to list, so the listing derives
//! those three from what the manifest declares, and the read/write routes
//! address them at `<agent>/<name>.rhai` - subdirectories included, since a
//! manifest may declare `validators/a2ui.rhai` and a route that could not open
//! it would be a listing entry nobody could act on. There is likewise no global
//! directory for them: a hook only ever loads from beside the agent that
//! declares it.
//!
//! What the manifest declares is not what a person is choosing between, though.
//! An editor offering a validator picker needs the files that *could* be named,
//! and a file is only declared once somebody has named it. `?include=candidates`
//! is that half: the `.rhai` files under the agent's directory that nothing
//! declares, reported as a `kind` of `unknown` and `declared: false`, under a
//! bounded walk that never leaves the agent's own directory.
//!
//! A **provider** is the inverse: `~/.leviath/providers/<name>.rhai` and nothing
//! else. No agent owns one, and a stage reaches it by name rather than by path,
//! so this route takes no `?agent=` and refuses one rather than inventing a
//! per-agent layout that nothing would load.
//!
//! A **mime check** is named by a registry row's `check`, and a row lives in
//! two places: the operator's `mime_types.toml` (or `[mime_types]` in the
//! config), whose scripts resolve against the config's directory, and a
//! blueprint's own `[mime_types]`, whose scripts resolve against the agent's
//! directory like its hooks. So this kind takes an `?agent=` or not, and the
//! listing derives it from the rows either way.
//!
//! # Why the write half is gated
//!
//! A blueprint is declarative. A `.rhai` file is executable code every agent
//! then runs, so `PUT` and `DELETE` are the same category of act as adding an
//! MCP server, and they are mounted the same way: absent entirely, 404, unless
//! `lev serve --allow-admin`. The `GET` routes stay open so an editor degrades
//! to read-only instead of disappearing.
