//! The WebSocket event vocabulary: what `/ws` and `/ws/agents/{id}` send, and
//! the bus that carries it.
//!
//! Split out of `types.rs` because this is a wire contract rather than an
//! internal shape. Every variant here is something a client matches on by its
//! `type` tag, so a change to one is a change to the API, and
//! `API_CAPABILITIES` in `config_types.rs` is where that gets announced.
//!
//! Everything a producer sends goes through [`send`], which is the one place a
//! frame is given its place in the stream: a [`Stamped`] wrapper carrying a
//! sequence number and the second it was sent. `/ws` serializes the
//! [`ServerEvent`] inside and nothing else, so its bytes are the bytes they
//! always were; a GraphQL subscription reads the stamp as well, which is what
//! lets a client tell a quiet fleet from a gap in what it was handed.
