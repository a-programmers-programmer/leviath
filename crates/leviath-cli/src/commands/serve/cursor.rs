//! The opaque pagination cursor every paginated route shares.
//!
//! **Keyset, not offset.** The collections being paged are live: runs are
//! created while a client walks the list, and finished ones can be deleted. An
//! offset into a shifting list silently skips and repeats items, and does it
//! most often at the head, which is exactly where a console looks. A cursor that
//! names *where you got to* rather than *how far in* cannot be shifted by an
//! insert or a delete elsewhere in the list.
//!
//! The key is a `(sort value, id)` pair. The id is the tie-break, and it has to
//! be there: sort values collide freely (two runs can start in the same second),
//! and a keyset walk over a non-total order loses whichever colliding item it
//! happened to resume past.
//!
//! Encoded as hex of a JSON payload. Hex rather than base64 because it is
//! URL-safe with no percent-encoding and both `hex` and `serde_json` are already
//! dependencies; base64 would buy ~30% shorter cursors and one more supply-chain
//! edge. It is opaque to clients - nothing may parse it - but a maintainer can
//! read one out of a bug report with `xxd`, which a compressed binary format
//! would not allow.
