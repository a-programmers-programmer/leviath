//! `POST /api/update` - carrying out the plan `GET /api/update` prints.
//!
//! The read route answers "am I current, and what do I type to fix it". This is
//! the half that does it: it runs `binary.commands`, installs the blueprints the
//! plan marks `preselected`, and applies the config migrations - the same three
//! steps `lev update` runs, from the same [`plan`], so the console and the
//! terminal cannot carry out different updates.
//!
//! # Why it is a job rather than a request
//!
//! A `brew update && brew upgrade` is a download and an install. It takes a
//! minute on a good day and can fail halfway, and an HTTP request held open for
//! it tells a console nothing until it is over - so the button would say
//! "updating" with no way to know whether anything was happening. The route
//! answers `202` with a job id immediately, the work runs behind it, and every
//! step change goes out on the websocket as it happens. A client that missed a
//! frame, or connected late, polls `GET /api/update/jobs/{id}` for the same
//! record.
//!
//! # What it will not do
//!
//! A `cargo install` copy is `binary.action == "advise"`, and stays advice: the
//! step is recorded as advised, with the plan's own sentence, and no compile is
//! started. Same for a binary in a directory no installer writes to. A blueprint
//! the user edited is never installed either - [`install_bundled`] removes the
//! destination directory first, so a bulk yes would take their edits and any
//! file they added with it, which is why `lev update` asks about each one on its
//! own and no flag covers it. There is nobody to ask over HTTP, so the answer
//! is no, said out loud in the step's detail.
