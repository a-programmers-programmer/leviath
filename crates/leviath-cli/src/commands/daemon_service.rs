//! `lev daemon install` / `lev daemon uninstall` - hand the daemon to the OS
//! supervisor so it comes back by itself after a crash.
//!
//! Without supervision, nothing restarts the daemon when it dies: a
//! long-running agent simply stops, and the next `lev run` is the only thing
//! that brings the daemon back. Registering a launchd agent (macOS) or a systemd *user*
//! unit (Linux) with a restart policy closes that gap - and on the next start
//! the daemon's own recovery pass reloads every interrupted run.
//!
//! This module is the tested core: rendering the unit file, resolving where it
//! goes, writing/removing it, and building the activation command line. Running
//! that command is real subprocess I/O and lives in the binary.
//!
//! Platform differences are `#[cfg]`-gated rather than branched at runtime, so
//! each target compiles exactly the code it uses (and covers all of it).
