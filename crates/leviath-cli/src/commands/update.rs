//! `lev update` - bring this copy of Leviath up to date, then everything that
//! shipped with it.
//!
//! Three steps, in the order that matters: the binary, the bundled blueprints,
//! and the config file. The binary first because the other two are decided by
//! what the *new* binary ships, and a user who updates the agents against the
//! old one has done half a job.
//!
//! All three run every time. The binary step is never a reason to skip the
//! other two, and this is the whole point: `brew upgrade` and `scoop update`
//! hand over a new binary and say nothing about the blueprints in the user's
//! agents directory or the config beside them, so anyone who has ever updated
//! that way is carrying blueprints from whenever they last ran `lev setup`. A
//! binary that needs no update is not evidence that anything else is current,
//! which is why "already up to date" is a sentence this command never says on
//! its own.
//!
//! # Why the install method is detected rather than guessed
//!
//! Every channel installs the same `CARGO_PKG_VERSION`: the `-alpha` and
//! `-beta` suffixes live in the tap manifests the release workflow bumps, not
//! in `Cargo.toml`. So the version string says nothing about which channel this
//! binary came from, and nothing about which installer put it there. What does
//! say something is *where the file is*: a Homebrew Cellar path carries the
//! formula name, and the formula name carries the channel; a Scoop `apps` path
//! carries the package the same way; `~/.cargo/bin` means somebody compiled it.
//!
//! The hosted install script is the one method that records nothing. It writes
//! a plain binary into an ordinary directory and keeps no receipt, so a copy
//! that came from it is indistinguishable from any other loose binary. That is
//! what [`UpdateArgs::channel`] is for, and why the script arm defaults to
//! `stable` and says so rather than inferring a channel it cannot know.
//!
//! # Seams
//!
//! Running the upgrade and asking the user a question are both injected (see
//! [`UpdateEnv`]), so the tests assert the command that *would* run without a
//! single process being spawned - the same shape `lev mcp` uses for the browser
//! and the daemon uses for seed commands.

Update Leviath, then offer to bring everything else up to date with it.

The binary is updated with the installer that put it there, which is worked out
from where the file is rather than guessed from the version string (every
channel ships the same version number, so the string cannot tell you):

  Homebrew   a Cellar path names the formula, and the formula names the
             channel: `brew upgrade leviath-beta`
  Scoop      the same, from the package under scoop/apps
  cargo      says to run `cargo install leviath-cli` and stops. Updating it
             means a long compile, which is not something to start unasked
  script     re-runs the hosted installer for a channel. The install script
             keeps no record of the channel it used, so this defaults to
             stable - pass --channel to say otherwise

The blueprints and the config are checked every time, whatever the binary step
did. `brew upgrade` on its own leaves both behind, and a binary that was
already current is not a reason to stop looking: an install can be months
behind on its blueprints with a `lev` that needs no update at all.

Nothing is written to your agents directory without a yes. The whole list is
printed first, then one confirmation covers it; --install-agents is how a
script says yes. --yes alone is not enough, because updating a binary and
replacing the blueprints in your agents directory are different requests. A
copy you edited is named as edited and asked about on its own, and no flag
covers it: installing removes the directory and takes your edits with it.

Config migrations are described line by line before anything is written, and
then asked about.

--check and --json report the plan and change nothing. --dry-run walks the
whole flow, prompts and all, and prints what each step would do instead of
doing it.";
