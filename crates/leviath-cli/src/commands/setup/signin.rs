//! Taking a browser sign-in from inside the wizard.
//!
//! A provider whose credential is an OAuth grant has nothing for the wizard to
//! ask for. The first version of the Codex row said so and stopped there,
//! telling the user to quit and run `lev auth login codex` - which meant the
//! one provider that needs no typing was the only one setup could not finish.
//!
//! So the sign-in happens here instead, and `lev auth login` goes back to
//! being what it is actually for: signing in again on a machine with no
//! wizard, or after a session has been revoked.
//!
//! ## The seam
//!
//! [`ProviderAuthorizer`] exists for the same reason [`ProviderVerifier`] does,
//! with one addition: this one opens a browser. `lev dash` once had a unit test
//! launch a real one, and a test that reached this without a seam would open a
//! browser *and* wait five minutes for a callback nobody was going to make.
//! Nothing in the library builds the live implementation; the binary wires it
//! in, exactly as it does the verifier.
//!
//! [`ProviderVerifier`]: super::verify::ProviderVerifier
