//! The two background lanes, and how their answers land on a provider row.
//!
//! Both exist for the same reason: the wizard draws on a tick, and anything
//! that waits on somebody else must not wait on that thread. A credential
//! check is a round trip; a browser sign-in is a person. Neither belongs in
//! the draw loop, so each is asked over a channel and drained per tick.
//!
//! They are separate lanes rather than one, because a sign-in can hold its
//! channel open for minutes and would stall every check queued behind it.
