/// when empty, and a save-back writes every field, so `lev setup` and every
/// config migration stamped it into each `[model_providers.*]` block.
///
/// Inert is not harmless once somebody is debugging. It reads as a declaration
/// that the provider serves nothing, which is exactly what a provider whose
/// `list_models` was never asked looks like from outside - so it got the blame
/// for a routing failure it had no part in. The real fault was priming, fixed
/// separately; this removes the thing that pointed at the wrong culprit.

/// [`RENAMED_KEYS`] instead, which the `renamed-keys` entry below reads.
