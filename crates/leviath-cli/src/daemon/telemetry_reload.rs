//! Rebuilding the telemetry pipeline when `[observability]` changes.
//!
//! The pipeline has two halves and both are swappable, so turning export on,
//! pointing it at a different collector, or turning it off again all take
//! effect on the next run rather than on the next `lev daemon restart`. The
//! sink is the world's `Telemetry` resource, replaced like any other resource;
//! the OTLP log bridge lives in a `tracing_subscriber` reload layer, which
//! `set_otel_layer` fills at boot and this refills (or empties) afterwards.
//!
//! Worth swapping rather than documenting a restart, because a sink stuck at
//! its boot value fails in the least readable way there is: you set
//! `enabled = true`, start a run to watch it, and nothing arrives - which looks
//! exactly like a collector that is not listening.
//!
//! The cap on the daemon's own log file (`log_file_max_bytes`) rides along:
//! every refresh hands it to the file writer, so raising it is a config edit
//! rather than a restart.
//!
//! What does **not** move is the base subscriber `logging::init` installs
//! before any config is read: the fmt layer, its writers, and its
//! `info`/`debug` filter. Those come from `--verbose` on the process's own
//! command line, not from `[observability]`, and a `tracing` subscriber can
//! only be set once per process. Changing how verbose the daemon's own log is
//! still means restarting it.
