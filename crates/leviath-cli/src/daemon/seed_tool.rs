//! Execution of `seed = { tools = [...] }` region seeds.
//!
//! A tool seed calls the run's own tools at spawn and writes their combined
//! output into a context region, so an agent starts its first inference already
//! knowing what the tools would have told it. The motivating case is the clock:
//! a research agent that cannot ask the date reasons from its training cutoff,
//! and a tool it is never prompted to call does not help.
//!
//! # Why any tool is allowed here
//!
//! Unlike a `command` seed, which runs a shell line and therefore needs the
//! `[safe_commands]` list and the `allow_seed_commands` switch to hem it in, a
//! tool seed reaches nothing new: every call goes through
//! [`crate::tools::resolve_policy`], the same resolution the tool lane applies
//! mid-run, so a user's `[tool_permissions]` decides exactly as it would there.
//! A seed cannot call what the agent could not call.
//!
//! That is what lets the list be open. A built-in, an MCP server's tool, a Rhai
//! script tool - all are callable, spelled as the agent would spell them.
//!
//! # Why `ask` cannot run
//!
//! A seed runs before the first inference and therefore before any approval
//! prompt exists; there is nobody to ask. Rather than silently escalating an
//! `ask` to an allow (which would make seeding a way around the permission
//! layer) or blocking forever, an `ask` tool is refused with a message naming
//! the setting that would let it run. `allow` runs, `deny` is refused, and both
//! read the same as they would mid-run.
