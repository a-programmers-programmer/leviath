//! The real [`ToolService`] for the shared world: bridges an agent's tool calls
//! to the built-in and MCP executors, applying the same policy / approval /
//! interaction flow the imperative worker used - but with interactions routed
//! through the in-memory [`leviath_runtime::interaction_hub`] instead of file
//! polling.
//!
//! The pipeline already applies `context_*` tools inline (they need ECS-window
//! access), so those never reach here. Every other call is resolved against the
//! agent's policy layers and executed; `ask_user_*` / `present_for_review` are
//! handled by [`dispatch_dynamic_interaction`]. File-tracking result rewriting is
//! deliberately *not* done here: this executor is ECS-free (no context window),
//! so the shared world's `collect_tools` applies the agent's `file_tracking`
//! config to these results downstream - where the window is available - via the
//! same path top-level agents use. Every daemon agent, sub-agent included, gets
//! file-tracking whenever its blueprint declares it.
