//! Restart recovery: reload persisted non-terminal agents into a fresh world when
//! the daemon starts, so runs interrupted by a stop/crash resume where they left
//! off - critically, any agent that was mid-inference re-issues that inference
//! (the reloaded agent is `ReadyToInfer`), rather than being lost.
//!
//! For each `<runs_dir>/<run_id>/meta.json` whose status is non-terminal, this
//! loads the blueprint (via [`build_agent_for_reload`], reusing the spawn path),
//! which skips the required-at-spawn region gate since the window is restored
//! from a snapshot; restores the
//! persisted context / stage / iteration / token totals via
//! [`leviath_runtime::restore::restore_agent`], puts the run's per-stage ledger
//! back from `stages.json` via
//! [`leviath_runtime::restore::restore_stage_ledger`], and preserves the
//! original run metadata. Anything unreadable or un-reloadable is skipped (logged), never fatal.
//!
//! One exception to the "re-issue inference" resume: a run that was parked at a
//! stage-boundary interaction point (e.g. `plan_approval`) wrote an
//! `interactions.json` sidecar while blocked. For those, `reload_one` calls
//! [`leviath_runtime::interaction_points::restore_interaction_point`] to bring the
//! agent back in the *waiting* state with the same prompt re-opened, rather than
//! re-inferring and dropping it. Model-initiated dynamic tools
//! (`ask_user_*`, `present_for_review`, `edit_document`) and taint-gate prompts are
//! not persisted - they block inside the transient tool-worker turn, so on restart
//! they take the ordinary re-inference path and the model simply re-asks.
//!
//! ## Tool-call delivery contract
//!
//! A tool batch in flight at the crash is **replayed, not re-executed**. Dispatch
//! journals the batch (a `ToolBatch` record) before its side effects can start,
//! and every call's result the moment it finishes (`ToolCallDone`); when the fold
//! surfaces such a pending batch, `reload_one` calls
//! [`leviath_runtime::restore::restore_pending_batch`] to land the assistant turn
//! with each completed call's real journaled result - so completed side effects
//! are exactly-once across a restart. Calls whose completion never reached the
//! journal (still executing, or the crash landed in the instant between the
//! external effect and its journal append - a window no journal can close,
//! since an external side effect can't be observed atomically) come back as
//! verify-first `[error] interrupted` results rather than being silently re-run;
//! the re-issued inference decides what still needs doing.
