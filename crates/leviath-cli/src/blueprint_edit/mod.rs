//! Editing an agent blueprint (`agent.leviath`) as a document.
//!
//! The dashboard's agent editor needs to change one thing about a manifest at
//! a time and hand back a file the author would still recognise: their
//! comments, their key order, their formatting. Nothing in the tree could do
//! that. `parse_manifest` reads a manifest into a [`Blueprint`], but there is
//! no writer for one, and `toml` re-emits from values, so every comment a
//! bundled agent carries would vanish on the first edit. So the editing model
//! keeps the manifest as a `toml_edit` document, the one source of truth, and
//! derives typed views from it on demand: [`ManifestDoc::stages`],
//! [`ManifestDoc::edges`], [`ManifestDoc::effective_regions`]. Keys the views
//! do not surface (fan-out policies the editor leaves alone, `[compaction]`,
//! table-shaped seeds, custom gates) round-trip untouched.
//!
//! The mutators refuse rather than produce a broken document: a name that is
//! not a name, a duplicate, a transition to a stage that does not exist, the
//! last stage deleted, all come back as an [`EditError`] and leave the
//! document as it was. What they cannot refuse (a stage with no model, an
//! unreachable stage) is [`check`]'s job, which runs the same parse, validate
//! and lint pass `lev validate` and the daemon's `POST /api/blueprints/validate`
//! run.
//!
//! The rules match The Lair's editor field for field (`blueprint/editable.ts`
//! in the leviath.dev repo), so an agent built here and one built there are
//! the same file: an empty string deletes a key rather than writing `""`; a
//! `direct` transform is written as absent; a new path is `hint = "Continue
//! here when appropriate"`; a new region is `pinned`, `5%`, `4000` tokens.
//!
