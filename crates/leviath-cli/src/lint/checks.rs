/// Stages whose every normal exit can run out of `max_revisits` budget.
///
/// A stage transitions along its `Always`/`LlmChoice` edges; an edge whose
/// target has `max_revisits` stops being followable once the budget is spent.
/// When EVERY normal edge is like that, a long enough run strands the stage
/// with nowhere to go, which the engine reports as a dead-end *error* rather
/// than as `complete` from the middle of the graph with the output stage still
/// pending. The live shape: a wide-researcher bouncing deep_dive → compare
/// until compare's budget runs out, with nothing produced.
///
/// The fix is one un-exhaustible way forward: an edge to a stage without
/// `max_revisits` (an output/terminal stage usually), or a
