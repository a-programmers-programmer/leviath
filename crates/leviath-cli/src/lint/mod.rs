//! Blueprint lint: the checks [`Blueprint::validate`] deliberately does not make.
//!
//! `Blueprint::validate` answers "is this manifest structurally coherent" - the
//! layout fits, the graph resolves, fan-out wiring points at real stages. It
//! says nothing about the fields whose *absence* quietly changes what a run
//! does, and those are what actually bite:
//!
//! - a stage with no `[stages.<name>.model]` table parses fine, because the
//!   parser substitutes a default, and then runs on whatever the user's default
//!   provider happens to be
//! - an agent-level `[model]` block is never read at all, so the author's model
//!   choice is discarded silently
//! - a typo in `available_tools` matches nothing, and the stage just advertises
//!   one tool fewer - the model is told the tool does not exist
//! - an autonomous stage granting `ask_user_text` parks in `WaitingInput` the
//!   first time it asks, with nobody there to answer
//!
//! Each of those is invisible on inspection and shows up hours later as a stuck
//! run. This module names them at author time instead.
//!
//! Questions about what the author *declared* ("is there a `mode` key?") are
//! answered from the manifest text, not from the parsed [`Blueprint`]: by then
//! the parser has already filled in its defaults, and asking the struct cannot
//! tell "wrote `autonomous`" apart from "wrote nothing".
