//! A portable, self-contained record of an entire agent run.
//!
//! A run archive is a single append-only file that captures everything about a
//! run - who owns it (which machine, which world/daemon instance), its metadata,
//! every inference and tool batch, inbound messages, and the evolving context
//! window - with enough fidelity that copying the file to another machine lets a
//! daemon **continue the run where it left off** (LLM non-determinism aside) or
//! replay it for debugging.
//!
//! ## Layout
//!
//! ```text
//! MAGIC ("LVR1") | version (u16 BE) | frame*
//! frame := len (u64 BE) | JSON-encoded RunRecord
//! ```
//!
//! The framing is binary and codec-agnostic (a future release can swap the JSON
//! payload for a compact binary codec without changing readers that only seek by
//! frame length). The first record is always a [`RunRecord::Header`].
//!
//! ## Portability / future migration
//!
//! [`RunIdentity`] records which machine + world/daemon instance owns a run, and
//! [`RunRecord::OwnershipChanged`] records a handoff. This is deliberately more
//! than today needs: the format is meant to eventually let a run start on one
//! machine, pause, and resume on another - including a machine declining a run
//! whose tools it lacks and waiting for a capable host. That scheduling logic
//! isn't built yet; the format simply reserves room for it (ownership handoffs
//! are first-class, the version field gates changes, and new record variants can
//! be added without disturbing the frame layout).
//!
//! ## Efficiency
//!
//! Context windows are the bulk of a run. Rather than snapshot the whole window
//! on every step, a writer emits an occasional full [`RunRecord::ContextCheckpoint`]
//! and, between checkpoints, small [`RunRecord::ContextDiff`] records describing
//! only what changed (the common case between inferences is a pure append to one
//! region). [`diff_context`]/[`apply_delta`] compute and replay those diffs, and
//! [`fold`] reconstructs the current state from the whole journal.
