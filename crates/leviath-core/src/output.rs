//! An agent's final output: the one value a run hands back to whoever asked.
//!
//! Before this existed, the only way an agent could return something was to
//! write a file. Every surface that should have reported a result reported
//! something else - `GET /api/agents/{id}/result` tailed a log file, the
//! completion webhook's `result` field carried the *error* string, and
//! `wait_for_agent`, whose schema promises "return its final result", returned
//! `"Sub-agent 'x' finished with status: Complete"`. A fan-out worker's
//! contribution to its merge stage was whatever text happened to sit in its last
//! assistant message, so a worker whose final turn was a tool call contributed
//! an empty string.
//!
//! # The format rule
//!
//! **Nothing here interprets the format.** There is no enum of supported
//! formats, no per-format parser, and no branch on a format name anywhere in the
//! engine. [`OutputSpec::format`] is an opaque label; markdown, JSON, XML, CSV,
//! an [a2ui](https://a2ui.org/) document, and a house format invented next week
//! all travel the same path: describe it to the model, record what comes back
//! verbatim, hand it on unchanged.
//!
//! The single exception is opt-in and named as such. When an author supplies
//! [`OutputSpec::schema`], the submission is parsed as JSON and validated
//! against it. That is the only thing that ever looks inside the content, and it
//! happens because someone asked for it, never because a format string said
//! `"json"`.
//!
//! This is also why an unusual format needs no engine support. There is no
//! usual: every format is produced by the model from
//! [`OutputSpec::instructions`] and [`OutputSpec::example`].
