//! Reading one typed field off a TOML value.
//!
//! The manifest parser asks "the string under this key, if there is one"
//! well over a hundred times. These are that ask, once per type, so a site
//! reads as what it wants rather than how it gets it. Each returns `None`
//! both for an absent key and for a value of the wrong type; a caller that
//! wants to tell those apart still looks at the value itself.
